## From the data fetched from AirBnb Dataset we address following problems. Although there exists numerous problems, I have focused this project on how can we use the data to extract information related to neighbourhoods:

1.  Which host has most number of listings in a neighbourhood?
2.  Analyzing neighbourhood according to top rated listings.
3.  Analyzing neighbourhood according to top and most frequently rated for value listings.
4.  What is the best type of rooms in each neighbourhood?
